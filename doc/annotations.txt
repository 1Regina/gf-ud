Annotations in GF-UD
Aarne Ranta


Annotations define the relation between GF abstract syntax trees and dependency trees.
There are two kinds of annotations:

- abstract annotations, which refer only to the abstract syntax
- concrete annotations, which refer also to the concrete syntax

Abstract annotations are in principle language-independent.
But if we want to match the conventions of some actual treebank, we may need to vary them, even in a "universal" annotation scheme such as UD.
Concrete annotations are defined for each language separately.
But it is possible to share some of them as well, in particular for languages that use functors in GF.

To enable maximal sharing of annotations across languages (and other variations on GF and UD side), annotations can be divided into multiple files.
The ``gfud`` program reads these files and builds a data structure that contains their union.


+Abstract annotations+

**Function**: ``#fun`` <abstract syntax function> <labels>
```
   #fun ComplV2  head obj
```
There must be a label for each argument.
Exactly one argument must have the label ``head``.
If the function has 1 or 0 arguments, the annotation is not needed.
Otherwise, ``gfud`` gives a warning about missing annotations.

**Category**: ``#cat`` <abstract syntax category> <POS tag>
```
   #cat V2	VERB
```
Many categories can have the same POS tag.
Only those categories that have lexical items (i.e. zero-place functions linearized to words) need this annotation.

Both function and category annotations must be unique in order for ``gf2ud`` to work.
However, in the ``ud2gf`` direction, two kinds of deviations may be needed:

**Alternative function**: ``#altfun`` <abstract syntax function> <labels>
```
  #altfun ComplV2 head obl
```
This is needed for UD, because the complement of a V2 verb can be labelled either ``obj`` of ``obl`` depending on the case governed by the verb.

**Disabled function**: ``#disable`` <abstract syntax function>
```
  #disable UseAP
```
says that the function ``UseAP`` is not to be used in ``ud2gf``.
The reason is that it is overshadowed by a macro function introducing an auxiliary copula.

**Auxiliary category**: ``#auxcat`` <abstract syntax category> <POS tag>
```
   #auxcat Cop AUX
```
The category ``Cop`` is introduced in the concrete syntax annotation for the syncategorematic copula verb (see below).
In the ``ud2gf`` direction, it is recognized when such a verb, marked by the POS tag ``AUX``, is encountered in the dependency tree.
This is done by means of auxiliary functions, whose format is somewhat complex, as they also have to define these extra functions in terms of standard ones.

**Auxiliary function**: ``#auxfun`` <new abstract syntax function> <argument variables> : <type> = <definition> ; <labels-and-features>
```
 #auxfun MkVPS_Perf have vp : Have -> VP -> VPS = MkVPS (TTAnt AAnter TPres) PPos vp ; aux[Tense=Pres] head
```
The number of argument variables and labels must match the type.
The type can be built from both ordinary and auxiliary categories.
As the definition shows here, the auxiliary category ``Have`` argument is ignored.
But the important thing is that
- its presence in the UD tree is recognized, ensuring that all words are taken into account.
- it sets the tense and anteriority of the VPS formed


Auxiliary functions do not necessarily contain auxiliary categories: they can be just macros collecting the applications of many functions.

**Annotation guideline**: ``#guidelines`` <name>
```
  #guidelines UD2
```
This flag is used to indicate what guidelines the annotations are checked against (if any).
The default it UD2.
It means checking that each label and POS tag is an actually existing UD2 label or tag.
An alternative is ``none``, meaning that no checks are performed.


+Concrete annotations+

**Syncategorematic words**: ``#word`` <word> <lemma> <morphology>
```
  #word is  be Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin
```
These annotations are used for words that appear syncategorematically, i.e. elsewhere than as linearizations of zero-place functions.
The lemma should be defined in a ``#lemma`` annotation

**Syncategorematic lemmas**: ``#lemma`` <functions> <lemma> <category> <own label> <target label>
```
  #lemma UseAP,UseAdv,UseNP be Cop cop head
```
This means that when any of the functions ``UseAP, UseAdv, UseN`` introduces the lemma ``be``, it is to be marked with the category ``Cop`` and the label ``cop``.
Its head will be the head of the same construction.
Notice that the category is typically an auxiliary category.

**Morphological tags**: ``#morpho`` <categories> <number> <morphology>
```
  #morpho V,V2 2 Mood=Ind|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin
```
This annotations tells how the PGF coordinates (numbers) are converted to morphological tags of UD.
The conversion depends on the category, since different categories have different PGF layouts.
To find out what the coordinates mean, one can use the text dump of the PGF invoked by the ``print_grammar`` command of GF:
```
  > import ShallowParse.pgf
  > print_grammar
    V := range  [C32 .. C32]
         labels ["s Inf"
                 "s PresSg3"
                 "s Past"
                 "s PastPart"
                 "s PresPart"]
```
The numbering of labels starts from 0.
Thus the third label, ``s Past``, is the one with number 2.
Comparing with a UD2 treebank shows that the morphological tag to be used is ``Mood=Ind|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin``.

**Discontinuous constituents**:  ``#discont`` <category> <head fields>``,head`` <other fields>
```
  #discont V2 0-4,head   5,ADV,advmod,head  6,ADP,case,obj
```
This is applied to discontinuous words, such as V2 with its verb particle (field 5) and preposition (field 6).
The head fields are those that contain actual verb forms.
The other fields need a POS tag, the word's own label, and the label of the word in the construction that becomes the head.
In this example, the particle (5) is linked to the head of the construction (i.e. the verb), whereas the preposition (6) is linked to the object.

//NB: the target label functionality is currently not implemented, but all fields are linked to the head.//


**Multiwords**: ``#multiword <category> <head-position> <label>:
```
  #multiword Prep head-first fixed
```
This annotation tells that, in a multiword preposition, the first word is the head, and the subsequent words are its dependents with the label ``fixed``.
This follows the guidelines in https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/specific-syntax.html; however, existing treebanks don't seem to follow this strictly.
The guideline example is //in spite of//, where //in// is the ``head`` and the other words are ``fixed``.

//NB: #multiword works so far only in the gf2ude direction, and head-last is not supported at all yet//
